Web scraping involves automatically retrieving data from websites using software tools called web scrapers. It enables users to extract specific information from web pages, such as text, images, or links. This process is commonly used for tasks like market research, competitive analysis, and data aggregation. However, web scraping raises ethical and legal considerations, particularly regarding the unauthorized use of data and potential violations of website terms of service. It's crucial for web scrapers to comply with ethical guidelines and respect website policies to avoid legal issues.
